# DNN
Implementing random deep learning things in julia for fun

Basic DNN works (no autoencoder/RBM training for deep tanh/sigmoid networks, sorry), only works on L1 loss right now.

Tutorial: Install julia, install IJulia and PyPlot, open command window in folder with NNTestbed.ipynb, run "ipython notebook --profile julia" and play with the notebook.

TODO:

-more loss functions

-refactor code to make it cleaner

-sigmoid/tanh pretraining with autoencoder

-(Clockwork) RNN/LSTM/capabilities with more exotic network structure
